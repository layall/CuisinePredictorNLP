Our code is written in Python and follows a simple structure, as it is all contained in one file. We first imported the libraries we needed, imported our data, set up our training data, created our model, trained our model based on the training data, looked at some metrics, and used our model on our testing data. We used stackoverflow and yahoo answers when we ran into bugs in our code. 

In terms of setup, download the libraries for inflect, nltk, re, numpy, pandas, punkt, and sklearn. The most important thing to do is to make sure the data (the .json files) are in the same place as the code so it can retreive it properly. If this doesn't work, copy and paste the full path of where the file is in your computer with an r infront of the quotes (ex for line 23: test = pd.read_json("r"C:\Users\layal\PycharmProjects\finalNLP\"test.json")). If all these things are done, then all you need to do is run the main.py file to see our model at work.

No current limitations in our implementation.
